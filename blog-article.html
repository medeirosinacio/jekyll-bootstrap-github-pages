                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity of the
                            free human mind. Because it transforms who we are, how we live, and it gives us an
                            understanding of our place in the universe.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The universe is large and old, and the ingredients for life as we know it
                            are everywhere, so there's no reason to think that Earth would be unique in that regard.
                            Whether of not the life became intelligent is a different question, and we'll see if we find
                            that.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you get asteroids about a kilometer in size, those are large enough and
                            carry enough energy into our system to disrupt transportation, communication, the food
                            chains, and that can be a really bad day on Earth.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">I have odd cosmic thoughts every day</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For me, the most fascinating interface is Twitter. I have odd cosmic
                            thoughts every day and I realized I could hold them to myself or share them with people who
                            might be interested.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect. I kind of want to know what happened
                            there because we're twirling knobs here on Earth without knowing the consequences of it.
                            Mars once had running water. It's bone dry today. Something bad happened there as well.</p>

                                    If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be
                                    private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and
                                    it has unquantified risks.

                                            of that enterprise. You can't get investors.

                                    When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find
                                    it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.
